# 4-bit_ALU_Verilog
An arithmetic logic unit(ALU) is a major component of the central processing unit of the a computer system. It does all processes related to arithmetic and logic operations.Here i make 4-bit ALU that can perform 4-bit arithamatic and logical operation.

# RTL Schematic
In this scheamtic we have 3 input and 1 output that can give us respective answer. in input we have two operands of 4-bit and one opcode of 3-bit, at output we have our result of 4-bit.
eatch operand respresent perticular operation as shown below.

# Output Waveform
after writing test bench with different input we have our output wave form as shown below:
